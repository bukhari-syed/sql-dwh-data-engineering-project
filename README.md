# Enterprise Data Warehouse & Insights Platform

Welcome to the **Enterprise Data Warehouse & Insights Platform** repository.  
This portfolio project simulates a real-world data warehousing solution, built from raw data ingestion through to analytical reporting. It reflects hands-on experience with modern data engineering practices and a layered architecture approach.

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

This solution is based on the **Medallion Architecture** pattern, broken down into three distinct layers:

![Architecture Diagram](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze** ‚Äì Raw data as received from source systems (CSV files). No transformations applied.
2. **Silver** ‚Äì Cleaned, validated, and standardized data ready for querying.
3. **Gold** ‚Äì Final business-ready tables modeled in a star schema to support reporting and dashboards.

## üìå Project Scope

This project showcases:

1. **Warehouse Design** ‚Äì Using a multi-layered architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold).
2. **Data Pipelines** ‚Äì Loading and transforming data from external flat files into a relational database.
3. **Dimensional Modeling** ‚Äì Creating fact/dimension tables for analytics.
4. **Reporting Logic** ‚Äì Writing SQL to extract key insights from the Gold layer.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Concepts Used:
- Azure Data Studio   
- ETL Process Design  
- Data Quality Checks  
- Dimensional Modeling  
- SQL for Analytics

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Requirements

### Data Engineering Goals

#### Purpose
Build a centralized warehouse using SQL Server that aggregates CRM and ERP data for analytics use cases.

#### Functional Requirements
- **Sources**: Load data from flat files representing ERP and CRM exports.
- **Data Hygiene**: Clean inconsistencies and handle missing values before transformation.
- **Integration**: Join and harmonize data across systems into a unified model.
- **Scope Limit**: Only the current snapshot of data is modeled (no historical tracking).
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear metadata and definitions to support future analysis.

### Analytics Objectives

#### Purpose
Generate SQL-based reports to surface insights in the following areas:
- Customer behavior
- Product performance
- Sales metrics over time

These reports provide business users with actionable KPIs for strategy and operations.

Refer to full analytics brief in [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md).
